# Longest Repeating Character Replacement

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You may choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most `k` times.

Your task is to return the length of the longest possible substring that contains only the same letter after at most `k` operations.
